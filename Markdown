# Your Repo

A forensic archive of automation abuse, identity mimicry, session hijacks, and the psychological payloads left behind by *that one guy* who thought I wouldnâ€™t notice.

This repo exists because:
- He wrote a bot to sound like me.
- He left his C2 metadata behind.
- And he underestimated the wrong woman with a notepad and a vendetta.

No names. No fiction.
Just metadata, screenshots, and receipts.
